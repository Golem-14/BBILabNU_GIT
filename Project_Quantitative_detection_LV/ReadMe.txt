This folder is dedicated to the PROJECT  Quantitative detection (L. Vassilets) 

Listing convention: the listing will be made in temporary progression, just add the next entry when you create a new script. If you modify a script input its title in the list below right under the name of the script you modify (for example if you want to work with  #### 2.1 SomeScript you list you modified script right under it #### 2.1.1 NameOfYourScript)

Be sure to use PROPER COMMENTING - so any changes you make are understandable to everyone. Modified scripts without proper comments will NOT be considered.

Add you name and contact information in the end of the script so people can contact you if they have suggestions and/or feedback, or reference you if you are a developer of the original script.

EXMAPLE: 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Script modified/developed (choose what applies) by YourName
% Contact info in case of issues and suggestions:
% YourContanctInfo@nu.edu.kz

*** If a script is marked as (UNDER DEVELOPMENT) it might not be fully ready to run and stable, it is better not to use it until the developer releases the final version.
