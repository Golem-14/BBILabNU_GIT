This is the repository for the Laboratory of Biosensors and Bioinstrumentation at Nazarbayev University.

Its main purpose is to organize work, and stimulate collaboration between the groups since eventually this repository can become a bird's eye view of the lab activity from the data analysis perspective.

It is an evolving active structure to which all the lab members are welcome to contribute.
