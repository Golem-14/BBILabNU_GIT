Here you can find scripts and open source apps created for data acquisition.


Listing convention: the listing will be made in temporary progression, just add the next entry when you create a new script. If you modify a script input its title in the list below right under the name of the script you modify (for example if you want to work with  #### 2.1 SomeScript you list you modified script right under it #### 2.1.1 NameOfYourScript)

Be sure to use PROPER COMMENTING - so any changes you make are understandable to everyone. Modified scripts without proper comments will NOT be considered.

Add you name and contact information in the end of the script so people can contact you if they have suggestions and/or feedback, or reference you if you are a developer of the original script.

EXMAPLE: 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Script modified/developed (choose what applies) by YourName
% Contact info in case of issues and suggestions:
% YourContanctInfo@nu.edu.kz

*** If a script is marked as (UNDER DEVELOPMENT) they might not be fully ready to run and stable, it is better not to use them until the developer releases the final version.

#### 1 unitedappPLUSscanspeedHM
An application for data acquisition (both calibration and detection) based on API of the MicronOptics. It runs at the background, so you can safely use the computer while acquiring the data. There is also an option to choose laser scan speed: 1000 Hz or 100 Hz. ENlight software uses 1000 Hz by default. There is possibility that 100 Hz instead can improve signal-to-noise ratio as the data is saved (as file .txt) only with max frequency 1 Hz. Contribute ONLY if you know how to improve it and after contacting the developer of the app (lyubov.vassilets@alumi.nu.edu.kz)
