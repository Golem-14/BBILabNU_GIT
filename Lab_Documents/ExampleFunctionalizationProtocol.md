**FUNCTIONALISATION PROTOCOL**

- **Piranha pre-treatment. 12 mL of H2SO4+3 mL H2O2**. Prepare the **Piranha solution** (4:1 v/v H2SO4:H2O2) and incubate the fiber for 15 min in glass beaker on rod.
- Rinse with DI water & dry
- Sialinization process: immersion in (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (\*\*APTMS\*\*) 1% in methanol for 20 minutes at room temperature. 14.85 mL of Methanol + 0,150 uL of APTMS.
- Wash with methanol and dry.
- **Heating at 110° C for 60 minutes**. Different glass rods, shorter.
- **For cross-linking**. Immerse sialinized fiber in a 50% **glutaraldehyde (GA)** solution for 1 h at room temperature in PBS (0.01M, pH 7.4) **\*500 uL of GA (50%) + 500 uL of PBS**.
- Rinse with PBS.
- Incubate with **CD44 antibodies** solution at 4 ug/mL at 4**°**C in PBS for 1h. (CD44 box). **\*4 uL of AB stock+996 uL of PBS**.
- **Block with 10% mPEG in PBS for 30 minutes** (0.05g mPEG+ 500 uL PBS -> 30 uL mPEG+270 uL PBS) (1:9). \* **50 uL mPEG+450 uL PBS**.
- Rinse in PBS. Store in PBS
